          Hello! My name is Dmytro, I'm 25 years old. I come from a small
          village in Vinnytsia region.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have an incomplete higher education (bachelor's degree) - studied at
          the National Aviation University, specializing in computer
          engineering, with a focus on computer systems and networks.
        </p>
        <p>I haven't worked in the field of my education :)</p>
        <p>
          In the company where I work, I am involved in both internal and
          external logistics in one of the departments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't have any commercial IT experience. When I was studying at the
          university during summer vacations, I came across an unconventional
          <a

          on HTML and CSS, and for me, it was like discovering a fantastic
          blockbuster in the wonderful world of the WWW. After reading it, I
          became interested in this field and started watching video tutorials
          on YouTube about website development and practicing a bit. I liked
          that with minimal time spent, you could see some results in the
          browser, and that was captivating. When I gained some knowledge (or so
          I thought back then :) ) in web development and perhaps a bit of
          audacity, I decided to venture into job searching. I succeeded, but it
          was a learning experience. I sent my resume to several web studios,
          and I got a response from the
          <a href="https://riverco.de/uk/" target="_blank">CODERIVER</a> web
          studio. I completed their test assignment (more or less) and they
          invited me to their training, which potentially could lead to a
          permanent position. Since it was winter and the holidays were
          approaching, I assessed my real chances of getting an offer from this
          studio, and after the third day of training, I went home for the
          holidays :)
        </p>

          So, for certain reasons, I stopped pursuing further learning in
          front-end development. Now that I have more free time, I've decided to
          return to learning. I learned about Beetroot from a Google search. I
          was choosing among several schools, and Beetroot appealed to me the
          most. I liked the price of the course. The cost of the course was
          important to me - it just needed to not be too cheap. I liked the
          curriculum, the instructor, and also the reviews on

        <p>Decision made, so here we go!</p>
